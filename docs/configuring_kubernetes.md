# Configuring Kubernetes

Minikube has a "configurator" feature that allows users to configure the Kubernetes components with arbitrary values.
To use this feature, you can use the `--extra-config` flag on the `minikube start` command.

This flag is repeated, so you can pass it several times with several different values to set multiple options.

## Kubeadm bootstrapper

The kubeadm bootstrapper can be configured by the `--extra-config` flag on the `minikube start` command.  It takes a string of the form `component.key=value` where `component` is one of the strings

* kubeadm
* kubelet
* apiserver
* controller-manager
* scheduler

and `key=value` is a flag=value pair for the component being configured.  For example,

```shell
minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.v=10 --extra-config=kubelet.max-pods=100

minikube start --extra-config=kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification # allows any version of docker
```
