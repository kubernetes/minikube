## Overview

[HyperKit](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit) is an open-source hypervisor for macOS hypervisor, optimized for lightweight virtual machines and container deployment.

{{% readfile file="/docs/drivers/includes/hyperkit_usage.inc" %}}

## Special features

minikube start supports additional hyperkit specific flags:

* **`--hyperkit-vpnkit-sock`**: Location of the VPNKit socket used for networking. If empty, disables Hyperkit VPNKitSock, if 'auto' uses Docker for Mac VPNKit connection, otherwise uses the specified VSock
* **`--hyperkit-vsock-ports`**: List of guest VSock ports that should be exposed as sockets on the host
* **`--nfs-share`**: Local folders to share with Guest via NFS mounts
* **`--nfs-shares-root`**: Where to root the NFS Shares (default "/nfsshares")
* **`--uuid`**: Provide VM UUID to restore MAC address

## Issues
* hyperkit has been deprecated for mac osX. The recommended alternatives for macOS are vfit, qemu, krunkit, and docker

### Local DNS server conflict

If you are using `dnsmasq` and `minikube` fails, add `listen-address=192.168.64.1` to dnsmasq.conf.

If you are running other DNS servers, shut them off or specify an alternative bind address.

## Troubleshooting

### Run with logs

Run `minikube start --alsologtostderr -v=7` to debug crashes

### Upgrade HyperKit

New updates to macOS often require an updated hyperkit driver. To upgrade:

* If Docker for Desktop is installed, click on icon in your menu bar and select `Check for updates...`
* If you have Brew Package Manager, run: `brew upgrade hyperkit`
* As a final alternative, you install the latest HyperKit from [GitHub](https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/releases)
* To check your current version, run: `hyperkit -v`
* If the version didn't change after upgrading verify the correct HyperKit is in the path. run: `which hyperkit`

### Check driver version

Run `docker-machine-driver-hyperkit version` to make sure the version matches minikube
