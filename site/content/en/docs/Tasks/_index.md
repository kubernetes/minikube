Each task should give the user

* The prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they're the same for all the page's tasks. "All these tasks assume that you understand....and that you have already....").
* What this task accomplishes.
* Instructions for the task. If it involves editing a file, running a command, or writing code, provide code-formatted example snippets to show the user what to do! If there are multiple steps, provide them as a numbered list.
* If appropriate, links to related concept, tutorial, or example pages.
