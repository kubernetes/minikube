While NodePort might be okay in a lot of circumstances, an ingress is necessary to test some features. Ingress controllers are great because you can define your entire architecture in something like a helm chart, and all your services will be available.\nHowever, for minikube, there is an additional challenge. Your ingress controller relies on DNS, so local DNS names like myservice.test will have to resolve to your minikube ip. The only real way to do this is to add an entry for every service in your /etc/hosts file. This gets messy for obvious reasons. For each service you are running that each has its own DNS entry, you will need to configure it manually. Even if you automate it, you then need to rely on the host operating system for storing configurations instead of storing them in your cluster. To make it worse, these configurations have to be constantly maintained and updated as services are added, removed, and renamed. I call it the /etc/hosts pollution problem.\nSolution What if you could just access your local services magically without having to edit your /etc/hosts file? Well, now you can. The ingress-dns addon acts as a DNS service that runs inside your Kubernetes cluster. All you have to do is install the service and add the minikube ip as a DNS server on your host machine. Each time the DNS service is queried, an API call is made to the Kubernetes master service for a list of all the ingresses. If a match is found for the name, a response is given with an IP address matching minikube ip. For example, with a minikube ip of 192.168.99.169 and an ingress rule for myservice.test configured in the cluster, a DNS query from the host would produce:\n#bash:~$ nslookup myservice.test $(minikube ip) Server:\t192.168.99.169 Address:\t192.168.99.169#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name:\tmyservice.test $(minikube ip) Address: 192.168.99.169 Installation 1Start minikube minikube start 2Enable the addons minikube addons enable ingress minikube addons enable ingress-dns 3Add the `minikube ip` as a DNS server On Linux, you should identify your domain name resolver configuration, and update its configuration accordingly. To that end, look at the first lines of /etc/resolv.conf:\nif it mentions resolvconf, resolution is likely handled by resolvconf, if it is # Generated by NetworkManager, resolution is handled by NetworkManager, if it similar to # This is /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf managed by man:systemd-resolved(8), resolution is handled by systemd-resolved. Start minikube, and apply the configuration below matching your system configuration.\nLinux OS with resolvconf Update the file /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base to have the following contents.\nsearch test nameserver 192.168.99.169 timeout 5 Replace 192.168.99.169 with the output of minikube ip.\nIf your Linux OS uses systemctl, run the following commands.\nsudo resolvconf -u systemctl disable --now resolvconf.service If your Linux OS does not use systemctl, run the following commands.\n# TODO add supporting docs for Linux OS that do not use `systemctl` See https://linux.die.net/man/5/resolver\nLinux OS with NetworkManager NetworkManager can run integrated caching DNS server - dnsmasq plugin and can be configured to use separate nameservers per domain.\nEdit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and enable dns=dnsmasq by adding:\n[main] dns=dnsmasq Also see dns= in NetworkManager.conf.\nConfigure dnsmasq to handle domain names ending with .test:\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/ echo \"server=/test/$(minikube ip)\" | sudo tee /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/minikube.conf Restart Network Manager:\nsystemctl restart NetworkManager.service Ensure your /etc/resolv.conf contains only single nameserver:\ncat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver nameserver 127.0.0.1 Linux OS with systemd-resolved Run the following commands to add the minikube DNS for .test domains:\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d sudo tee /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/minikube.conf \u003c\u003c EOF [Resolve] DNS=$(minikube ip) Domains=~test EOF sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved Create a file in /etc/resolver/minikube-test with the following contents.\ndomain test nameserver 192.168.99.169 search_order 1 timeout 5 Replace 192.168.99.169 with your minikube ip.\nIf you have multiple minikube IPs, you must configure a file for each.\nSee https://www.unix.com/man-page/opendarwin/5/resolver/\nNote that the port feature does not work as documented.\nOpen Powershell as Administrator and execute the following.\nAdd-DnsClientNrptRule -Namespace \".test\" -NameServers \"$(minikube ip)\" The following will remove any matching rules before creating a new one.

This addon provisions the required CRDs and deploys the Volume Snapshot Controller. It is disabled by default.\nFurthermore, the default storage provider in minikube does not implement the CSI interface and thus is NOT capable of creating/handling volume snapshots. For that, you must first deploy a CSI driver. To make this step easy, minikube offers the csi-hostpath-driver addon, which deploys the CSI Hostpath Driver. This addon is disabled by default as well.\nThus, to utilize the volume snapshots functionality, you must:\n1) enable the volumesnapshots addon AND\n2a) either enable the csi-hostpath-driver addon OR\n2b) deploy your own CSI driver\nYou can enable/disable either of the above-mentioned addons using\nminikube addons enable [ADDON_NAME] minikube addons disable [ADDON_NAME] The csi-hostpath-driver addon deploys its required resources into the kube-system namespace and sets up a dedicated storage class called csi-hostpath-sc that you need to reference in your PVCs. The driver itself is created under the name hostpath.csi.k8s.io. Use this wherever necessary (e.g. snapshot class definitions).\nOnce both addons are enabled, you can create persistent volumes and snapshots using standard ways (for a quick test of volume snapshots, you can find some example yaml files along with a step-by-step here). The driver stores all persistent volumes in the /var/lib/csi-hostpath-data/ directory of minikube’s host.\nMulti-Node Clusters csi-hostpath-driver addon supports Multi-Node Clusters volume provisioning. It deploys DaemonSet that runs hostpath on each node to provision and claim volumes (See #12360 for more details).\nTutorial In this tutorial, you use volumesnapshots addon(1) and csi-hostpath-driver addon(2a).\n1Start your cluster minikube start 2Enable addons Enable volumesnapshots and csi-hostpath-driver addons:\nminikube addons enable volumesnapshots minikube addons enable csi-hostpath-driver Optionally you could use it as a default storage class for the dynamic volume claims:\nminikube addons disable storage-provisioner minikube addons disable default-storageclass kubectl patch storageclass csi-hostpath-sc -p '{\"metadata\": {\"annotations\":{\"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class\":\"true\"}}}' 3Check volume snapshot class When you create the volume snapshot, you have to register Volume Snapshot Classes to your cluster.

Using the ~/.minikube/files/etc/ssl/certs directory is a workaround!

The ingress addon uses the ingress nginx controller which by default is only configured to listen on ports 80 and 443. TCP and UDP services listening on other ports can be enabled.\nPrerequisites Latest minikube binary and ISO Telnet command line tool Kubectl command line tool A text editor Configuring TCP and UDP services with the nginx ingress controller Enable the ingress addon Enable the minikube ingress addon with the following command:\nminikube addons enable ingress Update the TCP and/or UDP services configmaps Borrowing from the tutorial on configuring TCP and UDP services with the ingress nginx controller we will need to edit the configmap which is installed by default when enabling the minikube ingress addon.\nThere are 2 configmaps, 1 for TCP services and 1 for UDP services. By default they look like this:\napiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: tcp-services namespace: ingress-nginx apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: udp-services namespace: ingress-nginx Since these configmaps are centralized and may contain configurations, it is best if we only patch them rather than completely overwrite them.\nLet’s use this redis deployment as an example:\nredis-deployment.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: redis-deployment namespace: default labels: app: redis spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: redis template: metadata: labels: app: redis spec: containers: - image: redis imagePullPolicy: Always name: redis ports: - containerPort: 6379 protocol: TCP Create a file redis-deployment.yaml and paste the contents above. Then install the redis deployment with the following command:\nkubectl apply -f redis-deployment.yaml Next we need to create a service that can route traffic to our pods:\nredis-service.yaml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: redis-service namespace: default spec: selector: app: redis type: ClusterIP ports: - name: tcp-port port: 6379 targetPort: 6379 protocol: TCP Create a file redis-service.yaml and paste the contents above. Then install the redis service with the following command:\nkubectl apply -f redis-service.yaml To add a TCP service to the nginx ingress controller you can run the following command:\nkubectl patch configmap tcp-services -n ingress-nginx --patch '{\"data\":{\"6379\":\"default/redis-service:6379\"}}' Where:\n6379 : the port your service should listen to from outside the minikube virtual machine default : the namespace that your service is installed in redis-service : the name of the service We can verify that our resource was patched with the following command:\nkubectl get configmap tcp-services -n ingress-nginx -o yaml We should see something like this:\napiVersion: v1 data: \"6379\": default/redis-service:6379 kind: ConfigMap metadata: creationTimestamp: \"2019-10-01T16:19:57Z\" labels: addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: EnsureExists name: tcp-services namespace: ingress-nginx resourceVersion: \"2857\" selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/ingress-nginx/configmaps/tcp-services uid: 4f7fac22-e467-11e9-b543-080027057910 The only value you need to validate is that there is a value under the data property that looks like this:\n\"6379\": default/redis-service:6379 Patch the ingress-nginx-controller There is one final step that must be done in order to obtain connectivity from the outside cluster. We need to patch our nginx controller so that it is listening on port 6379 and can route traffic to your service. To do this we need to create a patch file.\ningress-nginx-controller-patch.yaml\nspec: template: spec: containers: - name: controller ports: - containerPort: 6379 hostPort: 6379 Create a file called ingress-nginx-controller-patch.yaml and paste the contents above.\nNext apply the changes with the following command:\nkubectl patch deployment ingress-nginx-controller --patch \"$(cat ingress-nginx-controller-patch.yaml)\" -n ingress-nginx Test your connection Test that you can reach your service with telnet via the following command:\ntelnet $(minikube ip) 6379 You should see the following output:\nTrying 192.168.99.179... Connected to 192.168.99.179. Escape character is '^]' To exit telnet enter the Ctrl key and ] at the same time. Then type quit and press enter.\nIf you were not able to connect please review your steps above.\nReview In the above example we did the following:\nCreated a redis deployment and service in the default namespace Patched the tcp-services configmap in the ingress-nginx namespace Patched the ingress-nginx-controller deployment in the ingress-nginx namespace Connected to our service from the host via port 6379 You can apply the same steps that were applied to tcp-services to the udp-services configmap as well if you have a service that uses UDP and/or TCP\nCaveats With the exception of ports 80 and 443, each minikube instance can only be configured for exactly 1 service to be listening on any particular port. Multiple TCP and/or UDP services listening on the same port in the same minikube instance is not supported and can not be supported until an update of the ingress spec is released.

Doing so has a few prerequisites:\nYou must install the kvm driver If you already had this installed make sure that you fetch the latest docker-machine-driver-kvm binary that has GPU support.\nYour CPU must support IOMMU. Different vendors have different names for this technology. Intel calls it Intel VT-d. AMD calls it AMD-Vi. Your motherboard must also support IOMMU.\nYou must enable IOMMU in the kernel: add intel_iommu=on or amd_iommu=on (depending to your CPU vendor) to the kernel command line. Also add iommu=pt to the kernel command line.\nYou must have spare GPUs that are not used on the host and can be passthrough to the VM. These GPUs must not be controlled by the nvidia/nouveau driver. You can ensure this by either not loading the nvidia/nouveau driver on the host at all or assigning the spare GPU devices to stub kernel modules like vfio-pci or pci-stub at boot time. You can do that by adding the vendorId:deviceId of your spare GPU to the kernel command line. For ex. for Quadro M4000 add pci-stub.ids=10de:13f1 to the kernel command line. Note that you will have to do this for all GPUs you want to passthrough to the VM and all other devices that are in the IOMMU group of these GPUs.\nOnce you reboot the system after doing the above, you should be ready to use GPUs with kvm. Run the following command to start minikube:\nminikube start --driver kvm --kvm-gpu This command will check if all the above conditions are satisfied and passthrough spare GPUs found on the host to the VM.\nIf this succeeded, run the following commands:\nminikube addons enable nvidia-device-plugin minikube addons enable nvidia-driver-installer NOTE: nvidia-gpu-device-plugin addon has been deprecated and it’s functionality is merged inside of nvidia-device-plugin addon.\nThis will install the NVIDIA driver (that works for GeForce/Quadro cards) on the VM.\nIf everything succeeded, you should be able to see nvidia.com/gpu in the capacity:\nkubectl get nodes -ojson | jq .items[].status.capacity Where can I learn more about GPU passthrough? See the excellent documentation at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF\nWhy are so many manual steps required to use GPUs with kvm on minikube?

Recently, Apple added support for eGPUs, but even then all the supported GPUs listed are AMD’s.\nnvidia-docker doesn’t support macOS either.\nWhy does minikube not support NVIDIA GPUs on Windows? minikube supports Windows host through Hyper-V or VirtualBox.\nVirtualBox doesn’t support PCI passthrough for Windows host.\nHyper-V supports DDA (discrete device assignment) but only for Windows Server 2016\nSince the only possibility of supporting GPUs on minikube on Windows is on a server OS where users don’t usually run minikube, we haven’t invested time in trying to support NVIDIA GPUs on minikube on Windows.\nAlso, nvidia-docker doesn’t support Windows either.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Prerequisites Linux Latest NVIDIA GPU drivers minikube v1.32.0-beta.0 …","ref":"/docs/tutorials/nvidia/","tags":"","title":"Using NVIDIA GPUs with minikube"},{"body":"What’s the difference between the four images?

This is a normal condition during cluster bring-up, and will resolve itself momentarily. For additional insight into your cluster state, minikube bundles the Kubernetes Dashboard, allowing you to get easily acclimated to your new environment:\nminikube dashboard 4Deploy applications Create a sample deployment and expose it on port 8080:\nkubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0 kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080 It may take a moment, but your deployment will soon show up when you run:\nkubectl get services hello-minikube The easiest way to access this service is to let minikube launch a web browser for you:\nminikube service hello-minikube Alternatively, use kubectl to forward the port:\nkubectl port-forward service/hello-minikube 7080:8080 Tada! Your application is now available at http://localhost:7080/.\nYou should be able to see the request metadata in the application output. Try changing the path of the request and observe the changes. Similarly, you can do a POST request and observe the body show up in the output.\nTo access a LoadBalancer deployment, use the “minikube tunnel” command. Here is an example deployment:\nkubectl create deployment balanced --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0 kubectl expose deployment balanced --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 In another window, start the tunnel to create a routable IP for the ‘balanced’ deployment:\nminikube tunnel To find the routable IP, run this command and examine the EXTERNAL-IP column:\nkubectl get services balanced Your deployment is now available at \u003cEXTERNAL-IP\u003e:8080\nEnable ingress addon:\nminikube addons enable ingress The following example creates simple echo-server services and an Ingress object to route to these services.\nkind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: foo-app labels: app: foo spec: containers: - name: foo-app image: 'kicbase/echo-server:1.0' --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: foo-service spec: selector: app: foo ports: - port: 8080 --- kind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: bar-app labels: app: bar spec: containers: - name: bar-app image: 'kicbase/echo-server:1.0' --- kind: Service apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: bar-service spec: selector: app: bar ports: - port: 8080 --- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example-ingress spec: rules: - http: paths: - pathType: Prefix path: /foo backend: service: name: foo-service port: number: 8080 - pathType: Prefix path: /bar backend: service: name: bar-service port: number: 8080 --- Apply the contents\nkubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube-site-examples/ingress-example.yaml Wait for ingress address\nkubectl get ingress NAME CLASS HOSTS ADDRESS PORTS AGE example-ingress nginx * \u003cyour_ip_here\u003e 80 5m45s Note for Docker Desktop Users: To get ingress to work you’ll need to open a new terminal window and run minikube tunnel and in the following step use 127.0.0.1 in place of \u003cip_from_above\u003e.\nNow verify that the ingress works\n$ curl \u003cip_from_above\u003e/foo Request served by foo-app ... $ curl \u003cip_from_above\u003e/bar Request served by bar-app ... 5Manage your cluster Pause Kubernetes without impacting deployed applications:\nminikube pause Unpause a paused instance:\nminikube unpause Halt the cluster:\nminikube stop Change the default memory limit (requires a restart):\nminikube config set memory 9001 Browse the catalog of easily installed Kubernetes services:\nminikube addons list Create a second cluster running an older Kubernetes release:\nminikube start -p aged --kubernetes-version=v1.16.1 Delete all of the minikube clusters:\nminikube delete --all Take the next step The minikube handbook Community-contributed tutorials minikube command reference Contributors guide Take our fast 5-question survey to share your thoughts 🙏 ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and …","ref":"/docs/start/","tags":"","title":"minikube start"},{"body":"Overview HyperKit is an open-source hypervisor for macOS hypervisor, optimized for lightweight virtual machines and container deployment.\nRequirements macOS 10.11+ HyperKit HyperKit installation If Docker for Desktop is installed, you already have HyperKit Otherwise, if you have Brew Package Manager, run: brew install hyperkit As a final alternative, you may Install HyperKit from GitHub Usage Start a cluster using the hyperkit driver:\nminikube start --driver=hyperkit To make hyperkit the default driver:\nminikube config set driver hyperkit Special features minikube start supports additional hyperkit specific flags:\n--hyperkit-vpnkit-sock: Location of the VPNKit socket used for networking.

We’ll explain kubectl in detail in the next modules, but for now, we’re just going to look at some cluster information. To check if kubectl is installed you can run the kubectl version command:\nkubectl version OK, kubectl is configured and we can see both the version of the client and as well as the server. The client version is the kubectl version; the server version is the Kubernetes version installed on the master.

We’ll do that by running kubectl cluster-info:\nkubectl cluster-info During this tutorial, we’ll be focusing on the command line for deploying and exploring our application. To view the nodes in the cluster, run the kubectl get nodes command:\nkubectl get nodes This command shows all nodes that can be used to host our applications.

Read on!\nNodePort access A NodePort service is the most basic way to get external traffic directly to your service. NodePort, as the name implies, opens a specific port, and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service.\nGetting the NodePort using the service command We also have a shortcut for fetching the minikube IP and a service’s NodePort:\nminikube service \u003cservice-name\u003e --url Using minikube service with tunnel The network is limited if using the Docker driver on Darwin, Windows, or WSL, and the Node IP is not reachable directly.\nRunning minikube on Linux with the Docker driver will result in no tunnel being created.\nServices of type NodePort can be exposed via the minikube service \u003cservice-name\u003e --url command. It must be run in a separate terminal window to keep the tunnel open. Ctrl-C in the terminal can be used to terminate the process at which time the network routes will be cleaned up.\nExample of NodePort Create a Kubernetes deployment\nkubectl create deployment hello-minikube1 --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0 Create a Kubernetes service type NodePort\nkubectl expose deployment hello-minikube1 --type=NodePort --port=8080 Check Node Port\n$ kubectl get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE hello-minikube1 NodePort 10.100.238.34 \u003cnone\u003e 8080:31389/TCP 3s Run service tunnel\nminikube service hello-minikube1 --url minikube service hello-minikube1 --url runs as a process, creating a tunnel to the cluster. The command exposes the service directly to any program running on the host operating system.\nservice output example $ minikube service hello-minikube1 --url http://127.0.0.1:57123 ❗ Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it. Check ssh tunnel in another terminal\n$ ps -ef | grep docker@127.0.0.1 ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -N docker@127.0.0.1 -p 55972 -i /Users/FOO/.minikube/machines/minikube/id_rsa -L TUNNEL_PORT:CLUSTER_IP:TARGET_PORT Try in your browser\nOpen in your browser (ensure there is no proxy set)\nhttp://127.0.0.1:TUNNEL_PORT Getting the NodePort using kubectl The minikube VM is exposed to the host system via a host-only IP address, that can be obtained with the minikube ip command. Any services of type NodePort can be accessed over that IP address, on the NodePort.\nTo determine the NodePort for your service, you can use a kubectl command like this (note that nodePort begins with lowercase n in JSON output):\nkubectl get service \u003cservice-name\u003e --output='jsonpath=\"{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}\"' Increasing the NodePort range By default, minikube only exposes ports 30000-32767. If this does not work for you, you can adjust the range by using:\nminikube start --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=1-65535 This flag also accepts a comma separated list of ports and port ranges.\nLoadBalancer access A LoadBalancer service is the standard way to expose a service to the internet. With this method, each service gets its own IP address.\nUsing minikube tunnel Services of type LoadBalancer can be exposed via the minikube tunnel command. It must be run in a separate terminal window to keep the LoadBalancer running. Ctrl-C in the terminal can be used to terminate the process at which time the network routes will be cleaned up.\nExample of LoadBalancer Run the tunnel in a separate terminal\nIt will ask for a password.\nminikube tunnel minikube tunnel runs as a process, creating a network route on the host to the service CIDR of the cluster using the cluster’s IP address as a gateway. The tunnel command exposes the external IP directly to any program running on the host operating system.\ntunnel output example Password: Status: machine: minikube pid: 39087 route: 10.96.0.0/12 -\u003e 192.168.64.194 minikube: Running services: [hello-minikube] errors: minikube: no errors router: no errors loadbalancer emulator: no errors ... ... ... Create a Kubernetes deployment\nkubectl create deployment hello-minikube1 --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0 Create a Kubernetes service with type LoadBalancer\nkubectl expose deployment hello-minikube1 --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 Check the external IP\nkubectl get svc $ kc get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE hello-minikube1 LoadBalancer 10.96.184.178 10.96.184.178 8080:30791/TCP 40s Note that without minikube tunnel, Kubernetes will show the external IP as “pending”.\nTry in your browser\nOpen in your browser (ensure there is no proxy set)\nhttp://REPLACE_WITH_EXTERNAL_IP:8080 Each service will get its own external IP.\nDNS resolution (experimental) If you are on macOS, the tunnel command also allows DNS resolution for Kubernetes services from the host.\nNOTE: docker driver doesn’t support DNS resolution\nCleaning up orphaned routes If the minikube tunnel shuts down in an abrupt manner, it may leave orphaned network routes on your system. If this happens, the ~/.minikube/tunnels.json file will contain an entry for that tunnel. To remove orphaned routes, run:\nminikube tunnel --cleanup NOTE: --cleanup flag’s default value is true.\nAvoiding password prompts Adding a route requires root privileges for the user, and thus there are differences in how to run minikube tunnel depending on the OS. If you want to avoid entering the root password, consider setting NOPASSWD for “ip” and “route” commands:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/1328452/sudoers-nopasswd-for-single-executable-but-allowing-others\nAccess to ports \u003c1024 on Windows requires root permission If you are using Docker driver on Windows, there is a chance that you have an old version of SSH client you might get an error like - Privileged ports can only be forwarded by root. or you might not be able to access the service even after minikube tunnel if the access port is less than 1024 but for ports greater than 1024 works fine.\nIn order to resolve this, ensure that you are running the latest version of SSH client. You can install the latest version of the SSH client on Windows by running the following in a Command Prompt with an Administrator Privileges (Requires chocolatey package manager)\nchoco install openssh The latest version (OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1, LibreSSL 2.6.5) which is available on Windows 10 by default doesn’t work.

When the rootless property is explicitly set but the current Docker host is not rootless, minikube fails with an error.\nIt is recommended to set the --container-runtime flag to “containerd”.\nSpecial features Cross platform (linux, macOS, Windows) No hypervisor required when run on Linux Experimental support for WSL2 on Windows 10 Known Issues The following Docker runtime security options are currently unsupported and will not work with the Docker driver (see #9607):\nuserns-remap On macOS, containers might get hung and require a restart of Docker for Desktop. See docker/for-mac#1835\nThe ingress, and ingress-dns addons are currently only supported on Linux.

Do I have to downgrade my minikube version? You do not need to download an older minikube to run an older kubernetes version. You can create a Kubernetes cluster with any version you desire using --kubernetes-version flag.\nExample:\nminikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.15.0 How can I create more than one cluster with minikube? By default, minikube start creates a cluster named “minikube”. If you would like to create a different cluster or change its name, you can use the --profile (or -p) flag, which will create a cluster with the specified name. Please note that you can have multiple clusters on the same machine.\nTo see the list of your current clusters, run:\nminikube profile list minikube profiles are meant to be isolated from one another, with their own settings and drivers. If you want to create a single cluster with multiple nodes, try the multi-node feature instead.\nCan I use minikube as a Docker Desktop replacement? Yes! Follow our tutorial on Using minikube as a Docker Desktop Replacement.\nCan I start minikube without Kubernetes running? Yes! If you want to use minikube only as a Docker Desktop replacement without starting Kubernetes itself, try:\nminikube start --container-runtime=docker --no-kubernetes Alternatively, if you want to temporarily turn off Kubernetes, you can pause and later unpause Kubernetes\nminikube pause minikube also has an addon that automatically pauses Kubernetes after a certain amount of inactivity:\nminikube addons enable auto-pause Docker Driver: How can I set minikube’s cgroup manager? For non-VM and non-SSH drivers, minikube will try to auto-detect your system’s cgroups driver/manager and configure all other components accordingly. For VM and SSH drivers, minikube will use cgroupfs cgroups driver/manager by default. To force the systemd cgroup manager, run:\nminikube start --force-systemd=true How can I run minikube with the Docker driver if I have an existing cluster with a VM driver? First please ensure your Docker service is running. Then you need to either:\n(a) Delete the existing cluster and create a new one\nminikube delete minikube start --driver=docker Alternatively, (b) Create a second cluster with a different profile name:\nminikube start -p p1 --driver=docker Does minikube support IPv6? minikube currently doesn’t support IPv6. However, it is on the roadmap. You can also refer to the open issue.\nHow can I prevent password prompts on Linux? The easiest approach is to use the docker driver, as the backend service always runs as root.\nnone users may want to try CHANGE_MINIKUBE_NONE_USER=true, where kubectl and such will work without sudo. See environment variables for more details.\nAlternatively, you can configure sudo to never prompt for commands issued by minikube.\nHow can I ignore system verification? kubeadm, minikube’s bootstrapper, verifies a list of features on the host system before installing Kubernetes. In the case you get an error and still want to try minikube despite your system’s limitation, you can skip verification by starting minikube with this extra option:\nminikube start --extra-config kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification What is the minimum resource allocation necessary for a Knative setup using minikube? Please allocate sufficient resources for Knative setup using minikube, especially when running minikube cluster on your local machine. We recommend allocating at least 3 CPUs and 3G memory.\nminikube start --cpus 3 --memory 3072 Do I need to install kubectl locally? No, minikube comes with a built-in kubectl installation. See minikube’s kubectl documentation.\nHow can I opt-in to beta release notifications? Simply run the following command to be enrolled into beta notifications:\nminikube config set WantBetaUpdateNotification true Can I get rid of the emoji in minikube’s output? Yes! If you prefer not having emoji in your minikube output 😔 , just set the MINIKUBE_IN_STYLE environment variable to 0 or false:\nMINIKUBE_IN_STYLE=0 minikube start How can I access a minikube cluster from a remote network? minikube’s primary goal is to quickly set up local Kubernetes clusters, and therefore we strongly discourage using minikube in production or for listening to remote traffic. By design, minikube is meant to only listen on the local network.\nHowever, it is possible to configure minikube to listen on a remote network. This will open your network to the outside world and is not recommended. If you are not fully aware of the security implications, please avoid using this.\nFor the docker and podman driver, use --listen-address flag:\nminikube start --listen-address=0.0.0.0 How can I allocate maximum resources to minikube? Setting the memory and cpus flags on the start command to max will use maximum available resources:\nminikube start --memory=max --cpus=max How can I run minikube on a different hard drive? Set the MINIKUBE_HOME env to a path on the drive you want minikube to run, then run minikube start.\n# Unix export MINIKUBE_HOME=/otherdrive/.minikube # Windows $env:MINIKUBE_HOME = \"D:\\.minikube\" minikube start Can I set a static IP for the minikube cluster? Currently a static IP can only be set when using the Docker or Podman driver.\nFor more details see the static IP tutorial.\nHow to ignore the kubeadm requirements and pre-flight checks (such as minimum CPU count)? Kubeadm has certain software and hardware requirements to maintain a stable Kubernetes cluster. However, these requirements can be ignored (such as when running minikube on a single CPU) by running the following:\nminikube start --force --extra-config=kubeadm.skip-phases=preflight This is not recommended, but for some users who are willing to accept potential performance or stability issues, this may be the only option.\nI am in China, and I encounter errors when trying to start minikube, what should I do? After executing minikube start, minikube will try to pulling images from gcr.io or Docker Hub. However, it has been confirmed that Chinese (mainland) users may not have access to gcr.io or Docker Hub. So in China mainland, it is very likely that minikube start will fail.\nFor Chinese users, the reason is that China mainland government has set up GFW firewall to block any access to gcr.io or Docker Hub from China mainland.\nMinikube is an open community and we are always willing to help users from any corner of the world to use our open-source software, and provide possible assistance when possible. Here are 3 possible ways to resolve the blockade.\nUse minikube start --image-mirror-country='cn' instead. Aliyun (a Chinese corporation) provides a mirror repository (registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers) for those images, to which Chinese users have access. By using --image-mirror-country='cn' flag, minikube will try to pull the image from Aliyun mirror site as first priority. Note: when a new image is published on gcr.io, it may take several days for the image to be synchronized to Aliyun mirror repo. However, minikube will always try to pull the newest image by default, which will cause a failure of pulling image. Under this circumstance, you HAVE TO use --kubernetes-version flag AS WELL to tell minikube to use an older version image which is available on Aliyun repo. For example, minikube start --image-mirror-country='cn' --kubernetes-version=v1.23.8 will tell minikube to pull v1.23.8 k8s image from Aliyun.\nIf you have a private mirror repository provided by your own cloud provider, you can specify that via --image-repository flag. For example, using minikube start --image-repository='registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers' will tell minikube to try to pull images from registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers mirror repository as first priority.\nUse a proxy server/VPN, if you have one. Note: please obey the local laws. In some area, using an unauthorized proxy server/VPN is ILLEGAL\nHow do I install containernetworking-plugins for none driver?

We’ll use the kubectl get command and look for existing Pods:\nkubectl get pods Next, to view what containers are inside that Pod and what images are used to build those containers we run the describe pods command:\nkubectl describe pods We see here details about the Pod’s container: IP address, the ports used and a list of events related to the lifecycle of the Pod.\nThe output of the describe command is extensive and covers some concepts that we didn’t explain yet, but don’t worry, they will become familiar by the end of this bootcamp.\nNote: the describe command can be used to get detailed information about most of the Kubernetes primitives: node, pods, deployments. The describe output is designed to be human readable, not to be scripted against.\nStep 2 - Show the app in the terminal Recall that Pods are running in an isolated, private network - so we need to proxy access to them so we can debug and interact with them. To do this, we’ll use the kubectl proxy command to run a proxy in a second terminal window. Run the command below in a new terminal window to run the proxy:\necho -e \"Starting Proxy. After starting it will not output a response. Please return to your original terminal window\\n\"; kubectl proxy Now again, we’ll get the Pod name and query that pod directly through the proxy. To get the Pod name and store it in the POD_NAME ennvironment variable:\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{\"\\n\"}}{{end}}') echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME To see the output of our application, run a curl request.\ncurl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME The url is the route to the API of the Pod.\nStep 3 - View the container logs Anything that the application would normally send to STDOUT becomes logs for the container within the Pod. We can retrieve these logs using the kubectl logs command:\nkubectl logs $POD_NAME *Note: We don’t need to specify the container name, because we only have one container inside the pod.\nStep 4 - Executing command on the container We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and running. For this, we use the exec command and use the name of the Pod as a parameter. Let’s list the environment variables:\nkubectl exec $POD_NAME -- env Again, worth mentioning that the name of the container itself can be omitted since we only have a single container in the Pod.\nNext let’s start a bash session in the Pod’s container:\nkubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- bash We have now an open console on the container where we run our NodeJS application. The source code of the app is in the server.js file:\ncat server.js You can check that the application is up by running a curl command:\ncurl localhost:8080 Note: here we used localhost because we executed the command inside the NodeJS Pod.

Containers may be able to execute arbitrary code on your host, by using container escape vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-5736. Please keep your release of minikube up to date. Decreased reliability minikube with the none driver may be tricky to configure correctly at first, because there are many more chances for interference with other locally run services, such as dnsmasq.\nWhen run in none mode, minikube has no built-in resource limit mechanism, which means you could deploy pods which would consume all of the hosts resources.\nminikube and the Kubernetes services it starts may interfere with other running software on the system. For instance, minikube will start and stop container runtimes via systemd, such as docker, containerd, cri-o.\nPersistent storage minikube expects that some mount points used for volumes are bind-mounted or symlinked to a persistent location:\n/data /tmp/hostpath_pv /tmp/hostpath-provisioner If you don’t have a dedicated disk to use for these, you can use the /var partition which is usually persistent.\nData loss With the none driver, minikube will overwrite the following system paths:\n/etc/kubernetes - configuration files These paths will be erased when running minikube delete:\n/data/minikube /etc/kubernetes/manifests /var/lib/minikube As Kubernetes has full access to both your filesystem as well as your docker images, it is possible that other unexpected data loss issues may arise.\nOther -p (profiles) are unsupported: It is not possible to run more than one --driver=none instance\nMany minikube commands are not supported, such as: dashboard, mount, ssh\nminikube with the none driver has a confusing permissions model, as some commands need to be run as root (“start”), and others by a regular user (“dashboard”)\nCoreDNS detects resolver loop, goes into CrashLoopBackOff - #3511\nSome versions of Linux have a version of docker that is newer than what Kubernetes expects. To overwrite this, run minikube with the following parameters: minikube start --driver=none --kubernetes-version v1.11.8 --extra-config kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification\nFull list of open ’none’ driver issues\nTroubleshooting Run minikube start --alsologtostderr -v=4 to debug crashes ","categories":"","description":"Linux none (bare-metal) driver\n","excerpt":"Linux none (bare-metal) driver\n","ref":"/docs/drivers/none/","tags":"","title":"none"},{"body":"Overview The podman driver is an alternative container runtime to the Docker driver.\nRequirements Install podman\nExperimental This is an experimental driver.

This is done providing a property name, and a property value.\nFor example, to persistently configure minikube to use hyperkit:\nminikube config set driver hyperkit You can get a complete list of configurable fields using:\nminikube config --help To get a list of the currently set config properties:\nminikube config view Kubernetes configuration minikube allows users to configure the Kubernetes components with arbitrary values. To use this feature, you can use the --extra-config flag on the minikube start command.\nThis flag is repeated, so you can pass it several times with several different values to set multiple options.\nSelecting a Kubernetes version By default, minikube installs the latest stable version of Kubernetes that was available at the time of the minikube release. You may select a different Kubernetes release by using the --kubernetes-version flag, for example:\nminikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.11.10 minikube follows the Kubernetes Version and Version Skew Support Policy, so we guarantee support for the latest build for the last 3 minor Kubernetes releases. When practical, minikube aims to support older releases as well so that users can emulate legacy environments.\nFor up to date information on supported versions, see OldestKubernetesVersion and NewestKubernetesVersion in constants.go\nEnabling feature gates Kubernetes alpha/experimental features can be enabled or disabled by the --feature-gates flag on the minikube start command. It takes a string of the form key=value where key is the component name and value is the status of it.\nminikube start --feature-gates=EphemeralContainers=true Modifying Kubernetes defaults The kubeadm bootstrapper can be configured by the --extra-config flag on the minikube start command. It takes a string of the form component.key=value where component is one of the strings\nkubeadm kubelet apiserver controller-manager scheduler and key=value is a flag=value pair for the component being configured. For example,\nminikube start --extra-config=apiserver.v=10 --extra-config=kubelet.max-pods=100 For instance, to allow Kubernetes to launch on an unsupported Docker release:\nminikube start --extra-config=kubeadm.ignore-preflight-errors=SystemVerification Runtime configuration The default container runtime in minikube varies. You can select one explicitly by using:\nminikube start --container-runtime=docker Options available are:\ncontainerd cri-o docker See https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/\nEnvironment variables minikube supports passing environment variables instead of flags for every value listed in minikube config. This is done by passing an environment variable with the prefix MINIKUBE_.\nFor example the minikube start --iso-url=\"$ISO_URL\" flag can also be set by setting the MINIKUBE_ISO_URL=\"$ISO_URL\" environment variable.\nExclusive environment tunings Some features can only be accessed by minikube specific environment variables, here is a list of these features:\nMINIKUBE_HOME - (string) sets the path for the .minikube directory that minikube uses for state/configuration. If you specify it to /path/to/somewhere and somewhere is not equal to .minikube, the final MINIKUBE_HOME will be /path/to/somewhere/.minikube. Defaults to ~/.minikube if unspecified. Please note: this is used only by minikube and does not affect anything related to Kubernetes tools such as kubectl.\nMINIKUBE_IN_STYLE - (bool) manually sets whether or not emoji and colors should appear in minikube.

You will also learn how to view and apply labels to objects with the kubectl label command.\nStep 1 - Create a new service Let’s verify that our application is running. We’ll use the kubectl get command and look for existing Pods:\nkubectl get pods Next, let’s list the current Services from our cluster:\nkubectl get services We have a Service called Kubernetes that is created by default when minikube starts the cluster. To create a new service and expose it to external traffic we’ll use the expose command with NodePort as parameter.\nkubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type=\"NodePort\" --port 8080 Let’s run again the get services command:\nkubectl get services Note for Docker Desktop users: Due to Docker Desktop networking limitations, by default you’re unable to access pods directly from the host. Run minikube service kubernetes-bootcamp, this will create a SSH tunnel from the pod to your host and open a window in your default browser that’s connected to the service. The tunnel can be terminated by pressing control-C, then continue on to Step 2.\nWe have now a running Service called kubernetes-bootcamp. Here we see that the Service received a unique cluster-IP, an internal port and an external-IP (the IP of the Node).\nTo find out what port was opened externally (by the NodePort option) we’ll run the describe service command:\nkubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node port assigned:\nexport NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}') echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT Now we can test that the app is exposed outside of the cluster using curl, the IP of the Node and the externally exposed port:\ncurl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT And we get a response from the server. The Service is exposed.\nStep 2 - Using labels The Deployment created automatically a label for our Pod. With describe deployment command you can see the name of the label:\nkubectl describe deployment Let’s use this label to query our list of Pods. We’ll use the kubectl get pods command with -l as a parameter, followed by the label values:\nkubectl get pods -l app=kubernetes-bootcamp You can do the same to list the existing services:\nkubectl get services -l app=kubernetes-bootcamp Get the name of the Pod and store it in the POD_NAME environment variable:\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{\"\\n\"}}{{end}}') echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME To apply a new label we use the label command followed by the object type, object name and the new label:\nkubectl label pods $POD_NAME version=v1 This will apply a new label to our Pod (we pinned the application version to the Pod), and we can check it with the describe pod command:\nkubectl describe pods $POD_NAME We see here that the label is attached new to our Pod. And we can query now the list of pods using the new label:\nkubectl get pods -l version=v1 And we see the Pod.\nStep 3 - Deleting a service To delete Services you can use the delete service command. Labels can be used also here:\nkubectl delete service -l app=kubernetes-bootcamp Confirm that the service is gone:\nkubectl get services This confirms that our Service was removed. To confirm that route is not exposed anymore you can curl the previously exposed IP and port:\ncurl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT This proves that the app is not reachable anymore from outside of the cluster. You can confirm that the app is still running with a curl inside the pod:\nkubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- curl localhost:8080 We see here that the application is up. This is because the Deployment is managing the application. To shut down the application, you would need to delete the Deployment as well.\nNext Module ➔\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Difficulty: Beginner Estimated Time: 10 minutes\nIn this scenario you …","ref":"/docs/tutorials/kubernetes_101/module4/","tags":"","title":"Module 4 - Expose your app publicly"},{"body":"Overview The Parallels driver is particularly useful for users who own Parallels Desktop for Mac, as it does not require VT-x hardware support.\nRequirements Parallels Desktop 11.0.0+ Pro or Business edition Usage Start a cluster using the parallels driver:\nminikube start --driver=parallels To make parallels the default driver:\nminikube config set driver parallels Issues Full list of open ‘parallels’ driver issues Troubleshooting Run minikube start --alsologtostderr -v=7 to debug crashes ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Overview The Parallels driver is particularly useful for users who own …","ref":"/docs/drivers/parallels/","tags":"","title":"parallels"},{"body":"Tutorials are complete worked examples made up of multiple tasks that guide the user through a relatively simple but realistic scenario: building an application that uses some of your project’s features, for example.

If not, run the command again. This shows:\nNAME lists the names of the Deployments in the cluster. READY shows the ratio of CURRENT/DESIRED replicas UP-TO-DATE displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state. AVAILABLE displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. AGE displays the amount of time that the application has been running. To see the ReplicaSet created by the Deployment, run:\nkubectl get rs Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as [DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[RANDOM-STRING]. The random string is randomly generated and uses the pod-template-hash as a seed.\nTwo important columns of this command are:\nDESIRED displays the desired number of replicas of the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is the desired state. CURRENT displays how many replicas are currently running. Next, let’s scale the Deployment to 4 replicas. We’ll use the kubectl scale command, following by the deployment type, name and desired number of instances:\nkubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4 To list your Deployments once again, use get deployments:\nkubectl get deployments The change was applied, and we have 4 instances of the application available. Next, let’s check if the number of Pods changed:\nkubectl get pods -o wide There are 4 Pods now, with different IP addresses. The change was registered in the Deployment events log. The check that, use the describe command:\nkubectl describe deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp You can also view in the output of this command that there are 4 replicas now.\nStep 2 - Load Balancing Let’s check that the Service is load-balancing the traffic. To find out the exposed IP and Port we can use the describe service as we learned in the previous Module:\nkubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp Note for Docker Desktop users: Due to Docker Desktop networking limitations, by default you’re unable to access pods directly from the host. Run minikube service kubernetes-bootcamp, this will create a SSH tunnel from the pod to your host and open a window in your default browser that’s connected to the service. Refresh the browser page to see the load-balancing working. The tunnel can be terminated by pressing control-C, then continue on to Step 3.\nCreate an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has a value as the Node port:\nexport NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}') echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT Next, we’ll do a curl to the exposed IP and port. Execute the command multiple times:\ncurl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT We hit a different Pod with every request. This demonstrates that the load-balancing is working.\nStep 3 - Scale Down To scale down the Service to 2 replicas, run again the scale command:\nkubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=2 List the Deployments to check if the change was applied with the get deployments command:\nkubectl get deployments The number of replicas decreased to 2. List the number of Pods, with get pods:\nkubectl get pods -o wide This confirms that 2 Pods were terminated.\nNext Module ➔\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Difficulty: Beginner Estimated Time: 10 minutes\nThe goal of this …","ref":"/docs/tutorials/kubernetes_101/module5/","tags":"","title":"Module 5 - Scale up your app"},{"body":"Glossary:\nPull means downloading a container image directly from a remote registry.\nPush means uploading a container image directly to a remote registry.\nLoad takes an image that is available as an archive, and makes it available in the cluster.\nSave saves an image into an archive.\nBuild takes a “build context” (directory) and creates a new image in the cluster from it.\nTag means assigning a name and tag.\nComparison table for different methods The best method to push your image to minikube depends on the container-runtime you built your cluster with (the default is docker). Here is a comparison table to help you choose:\nMethod Supported Runtimes Performance Load Build docker-env command docker \u0026 containerd good yes yes cache command all ok yes no podman-env command only cri-o good yes yes registry addon all ok yes no minikube ssh all best yes* yes* ctr/buildctl command only containerd good yes yes image load command all ok yes no image build command all ok no yes Note 1: The default container-runtime on minikube is docker. Note 2: The none driver (bare metal) does not need pushing image to the cluster, as any image on your system is already available to the Kubernetes cluster. Note 3: When using ssh to run the commands, the files to load or build must already be available on the node (not only on the client host). 1. Pushing directly to the in-cluster Docker daemon (docker-env) This is similar to podman-env but only for Docker runtime. When using a container or VM driver (all drivers except none), you can reuse the Docker daemon inside minikube cluster. This means you don’t have to build on your host machine and push the image into a docker registry. You can just build inside the same docker daemon as minikube which speeds up local experiments.\nTo point your terminal to use the docker daemon inside minikube run this:\neval $(minikube docker-env) eval $(minikube docker-env) PowerShell\n\u0026 minikube -p minikube docker-env --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression cmd\n@FOR /f \"tokens=*\" %i IN ('minikube -p minikube docker-env --shell cmd') DO @%i Now any ‘docker’ command you run in this current terminal will run against the docker inside minikube cluster.\nSo if you do the following commands, it will show you the containers inside the minikube, inside minikube’s VM or Container.\ndocker ps Now you can ‘build’ against the docker inside minikube, which is instantly accessible to kubernetes cluster.\ndocker build -t my_image . To verify your terminal is using minikube’s docker-env you can check the value of the environment variable MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD to reflect the cluster name.\nTip 1: Remember to turn off the imagePullPolicy:Always (use imagePullPolicy:IfNotPresent or imagePullPolicy:Never) in your yaml file. Otherwise Kubernetes won’t use your locally build image and it will pull from the network.\nTip 2: Evaluating the docker-env is only valid for the current terminal. By closing the terminal, you will go back to using your own system’s docker daemon.\nTip 3: In container-based drivers such as Docker or Podman, you will need to re-do docker-env each time you restart your minikube cluster.\nMore information on docker-env\n2. Push images using ‘cache’ command. From your host, you can push a Docker image directly to minikube. This image will be cached and automatically pulled into all future minikube clusters created on the machine\nminikube cache add alpine:latest The add command will store the requested image to $MINIKUBE_HOME/cache/images, and load it into the minikube cluster’s container runtime environment automatically.\nTip 1 : If your image changes after your cached it, you need to do ‘cache reload’.\nminikube refreshes the cache images on each start. However to reload all the cached images on demand, run this command :\nminikube cache reload Tip 2 : If you have multiple clusters, the cache command will load the image for all of them.\nTo display images you have added to the cache:\nminikube cache list This listing will not include the images minikube’s built-in system images.\nminikube cache delete \u003cimage name\u003e For more information, see:\nReference: cache command 3. Pushing directly to in-cluster CRI-O. (podman-env) This is similar to docker-env but only for CRI-O runtime. To push directly to CRI-O, configure podman client on your host using the podman-env command in your shell:\neval $(minikube podman-env) You should now be able to use podman client on the command line on your host machine talking to the podman service inside the minikube VM:\npodman-remote help Now you can ‘build’ against the storage inside minikube, which is instantly accessible to kubernetes cluster.\npodman-remote build -t my_image .

Note: On Windows the remote client is called “podman”, since there is no local “podman” program available.\nRemember to turn off the imagePullPolicy:Always (use imagePullPolicy:IfNotPresent or imagePullPolicy:Never), as otherwise Kubernetes won’t use images you built locally.\n4. Pushing to an in-cluster using Registry addon For illustration purpose, we will assume that minikube VM has one of the ip from 192.168.39.0/24 subnet. If you have not overridden these subnets as per networking guide, you can find out default subnet being used by minikube for a specific OS and driver combination here which is subject to change. Replace 192.168.39.0/24 with appropriate values for your environment wherever applicable.\nEnsure that docker is configured to use 192.168.39.0/24 as insecure registry. Refer here for instructions.\nEnsure that 192.168.39.0/24 is enabled as insecure registry in minikube. Refer here for instructions..\nEnable minikube registry addon:\nminikube addons enable registry Build docker image and tag it appropriately:\ndocker build --tag $(minikube ip):5000/test-img . Push docker image to minikube registry:\ndocker push $(minikube ip):5000/test-img 5. Building images inside of minikube using SSH Use minikube ssh to run commands inside the minikube node, and run the build command directly there. Any command you run there will run against the same daemon / storage that kubernetes cluster is using.\nFor Docker, use:\ndocker build For more information on the docker build command, read the Docker documentation (docker.com).\nFor CRI-O, use:\nsudo podman build For more information on the podman build command, read the Podman documentation (podman.io).\nFor Containerd, use:\nsudo ctr images import sudo buildctl build For more information on the ctr images command, read the containerd documentation (containerd.io)\nFor more information on the buildctl build command, read the Buildkit documentation (mobyproject.org).\nTo exit minikube ssh and come back to your terminal type:\nexit 6. Pushing directly to in-cluster containerd (buildkitd) This is similar to docker-env and podman-env but only for Containerd runtime.\nCurrently it requires starting the daemon and setting up the tunnels manually.\nctr instructions In order to access containerd, you need to log in as root. This requires adding the ssh key to /root/authorized_keys..\ndocker@minikube:~$ sudo mkdir /root/.ssh docker@minikube:~$ sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh docker@minikube:~$ sudo cp .ssh/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys docker@minikube:~$ sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh Note the flags that are needed for the ssh command.\nminikube --alsologtostderr ssh --native-ssh=false Tunnel the containerd socket to the host, from the machine.

You will need to run minikube addons configure registry-creds and minikube addons enable registry-creds to get up and running. An example of this is below:\n$ minikube addons configure registry-creds Do you want to enable AWS Elastic Container Registry? [y/n]: n Do you want to enable Google Container Registry? [y/n]: y -- Enter path to credentials (e.g. /home/user/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json):/home/user/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json Do you want to enable Docker Registry? [y/n]: n Do you want to enable Azure Container Registry? [y/n]: n registry-creds was successfully configured $ minikube addons enable registry-creds Google Artifact Registry: minikube has an addon, gcp-auth, which maps credentials into minikube to support pulling from Google Artifact Registry. Run minikube addons enable gcp-auth to configure the authentication. You can refer to the full docs here.\nFor additional information on private container registries, see this page.\nWe recommend you use ImagePullSecrets, but if you would like to configure access on the minikube VM you can place the .dockercfg in the /home/docker directory or the config.json in the /var/lib/kubelet directory. Make sure to restart your kubelet (for kubeadm) process with sudo systemctl restart kubelet.\nEnabling Insecure Registries minikube allows users to configure the docker engine’s --insecure-registry flag.\nYou can use the --insecure-registry flag on the minikube start command to enable insecure communication between the docker engine and registries listening to requests from the CIDR range.\nOne nifty hack is to allow the kubelet running in minikube to talk to registries deployed inside a pod in the cluster without backing them with TLS certificates. Because the default service cluster IP is known to be available at 10.0.0.1, users can pull images from registries deployed inside the cluster by creating the cluster with minikube start --insecure-registry \"10.0.0.0/24\". Ensure the cluster is deleted using minikube delete before starting with the --insecure-registry flag.\ndocker on macOS Quick guide for configuring minikube and docker on macOS, enabling docker to push images to minikube’s registry.\nThe first step is to enable the registry addon:\nminikube addons enable registry Note: Minikube will generate a port and request you use that port when enabling registry. That instruction is not related to this guide.\nWhen enabled, the registry addon exposes its port 5000 on the minikube’s virtual machine.\nIn order to make docker accept pushing images to this registry, we have to redirect port 5000 on the docker virtual machine over to port 5000 on the minikube machine. We can (ab)use docker’s network configuration to instantiate a container on the docker’s host, and run socat there:\ndocker run --rm -it --network=host alpine ash -c \"apk add socat \u0026\u0026 socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):5000\" Once socat is running it’s possible to push images to the minikube registry:\ndocker tag my/image localhost:5000/myimage docker push localhost:5000/myimage After the image is pushed, refer to it by localhost:5000/{name} in kubectl specs.\nDocker on Windows Quick guide for configuring minikube and docker on Windows, enabling docker to push images to minikube’s registry.\nThe first step is to enable the registry addon:\nminikube addons enable registry When enabled, the registry addon exposes its port 80 on the minikube’s virtual machine. You can confirm this by:\nkubectl get service --namespace kube-system \u003e NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE \u003e kube-dns ClusterIP 10.96.0.10 \u003cnone\u003e 53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP 54m \u003e registry ClusterIP 10.98.34.133 \u003cnone\u003e 80/TCP,443/TCP 37m In order to make docker accept pushing images to this registry, we have to redirect port 5000 on the docker virtual machine over to port 80 on the minikube registry service. Unfortunately, the docker vm cannot directly see the IP address of the minikube vm. To fix this, you will have to add one more level of redirection.\nUse kubectl port-forward to map your local workstation to the minikube vm\nkubectl port-forward --namespace kube-system service/registry 5000:80 On your local machine you should now be able to reach the minikube registry by using curl http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog\nFrom this point we can (ab)use docker’s network configuration to instantiate a container on the docker’s host, and run socat there to redirect traffic going to the docker vm’s port 5000 to port 5000 on your host workstation.\ndocker run --rm -it --network=host alpine ash -c \"apk add socat \u0026\u0026 socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:host.docker.internal:5000\" Once socat is running it’s possible to push images to the minikube registry from your local workstation:\ndocker tag my/image localhost:5000/myimage docker push localhost:5000/myimage After the image is pushed, refer to it by localhost:5000/{name} in kubectl specs.\n","categories":"","description":"How to interact with registries\n","excerpt":"How to interact with registries\n","ref":"/docs/handbook/registry/","tags":"","title":"Registries"},{"body":"Overview The vmware driver supports virtualization across all VMware based hypervisors.\nRequirements VMware Fusion Driver Installation If the Brew Package Manager is installed, run:\nbrew install docker-machine-driver-vmware Otherwise:\nr=https://api.github.com/repos/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-vmware d=docker-machine-driver-vmware_darwin_amd64 u=$(curl -s $r/releases/latest | grep -o 'http.*Darwin_amd64.tar.gz' | head -n1) mkdir $d \\ \u0026\u0026 (cd $d \u0026\u0026 curl -L $u \u003e $d.tar.gz \u0026\u0026 tar -xf $d.tar.gz) \\ \u0026\u0026 install $d/docker-machine-driver-vmware /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-vmware \\ \u0026\u0026 rm -rf $d Usage Start a cluster using the vmware driver:\nminikube start --driver=vmware To make vmware the default driver:\nminikube config set driver vmware No documentation is available yet.\nRequirements VMware Workstation Driver Installation First install the VMware Workstation\nAfter installation, start a cluster using the vmware driver:\nminikube start --driver vmware Issues Full list of open ‘vmware-driver’ issues Troubleshooting Run minikube start --alsologtostderr -v=7 to debug crashes ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Overview The vmware driver supports virtualization across all VMware …","ref":"/docs/drivers/vmware/","tags":"","title":"vmware"},{"body":"Untrusted Root Certificates Many organizations deploy their own Root Certificate and CA service inside the corporate networks.

This is useful since it allows the network policies to be, considered, built, and evaluated during the application development, as an integral part of the process rather than “bolted on” at the end of development.\nKubernetes NetworkPolicies allow the control of pod network traffic passing through the cluster, at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4). The linked page provides much more information about the functionality and implementation.\nHowever, the prerequisites note that Network policies are implemented by the Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin. Therefore to use or test network policies in any Kubernetes cluster, you must be using a networking solution which supports NetworkPolicy. Creating a NetworkPolicy resource without a controller that implements it will have no effect.\nA vanilla minikube installation (minikube start) does not support any NetworkPolicies, since the default CNI, Kindnet, does not support Network Policies, by design.\nHowever, minikube can support NetworkPolicies if a supported CNI, such as Calico, is installed. In addition, in this scenario both Kubernetes network policy and Calico network policy are supported.\nCalico network policy provides a richer set of policy capabilities than Kubernetes network policy including:\npolicy ordering/priority deny rules more flexible match rules Enabling Calico on a minikube cluster It is possible to replace the CNI on a running minikube cluster, but it is significantly easier to simply append the --cni calico flag to the minikube start command when following the instructions on the Get Started! page to build the minikube cluster with Calico installed from the outset.\nKubernetes Network Policy example The Kubernetes documentation on declaring network policy is a good place to start to understand the possibilities. In addition, the tutorials in Further reading below give much more guidance.\nThe YAML below from the Kubernetes NetworkPolicies documentation shows a very simple default ingress isolation policy on a namespace by creating a NetworkPolicy that selects all pods but does not allow any ingress traffic to those pods.\n--- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny-ingress spec: podSelector: {} policyTypes: - Ingress Calico Network Policy example The Calico network policy documentation is the best place to learn about the extended feature set of Calico network policy and how it coexists with Kubernetes network policy.\nThe YAML below from the Calico policy tutorial shows a very simple default deny Global Calico Network Policy (not available with vanilla Kubernetes network policy) that is often used as a starting point for an effective zero-trust network model. Note that Global Calico Network Policies are not namespaced and affect all pods that match the policy selector. In contrast, Kubernetes Network Policies are namespaced, so you would need to create a default deny policy per namespace to achieve the same effect. In this example pods in the kube-system namespace are excluded to keep Kubernetes itself running smoothly.\n--- apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3 kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy metadata: name: default-deny spec: selector: projectcalico.org/namespace != \"kube-system\" types: - Ingress - Egress Further reading This Advanced Kubernetes policy tutorial gives an example of what can be achieved with Kubernetes network policy. It walks through using Kubernetes NetworkPolicy to define more complex network policies.\nThis Calico policy tutorial demonstrates the extended functionalities Calico network policy offers over and above vanilla Kubernetes network policies. To demonstrate this, this tutorial follows a similar approach to the tutorial above, but instead uses Calico network policies and highlights differences between the two policy types, making use of features that are not available in Kubernetes network policies.\n","categories":"","description":"Controlling traffic flowing through the cluster\n","excerpt":"Controlling traffic flowing through the cluster\n","ref":"/docs/handbook/network_policy/","tags":"","title":"Network Policy"},{"body":"Community triage takes place every Wednesday from 11:05AM-11:55PM PT.\nHangouts link: https://meet.google.com/sss-wdet-gwe Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/minikube-dev All community members are welcome and encouraged to join and help us triage minikube!\nTriage is an important part of maintaining the health of the minikube repo.

This manages provisioning of hostPath volumes (rather then via the previous, in-tree hostPath provider).\nThe default Storage Provisioner Controller is managed internally, in the minikube codebase, demonstrating how easy it is to plug a custom storage controller into kubernetes as a storage component of the system, and provides pods with dynamically, to test your pod’s behaviour when persistent storage is mapped to it.\nNote that this is not a CSI based storage provider, rather, it simply declares a PersistentVolume object of type hostpath dynamically when the controller see’s that there is an outstanding storage request.\nThere is also CSI Hostpath Driver addon that enables dynamic provisioning and supports multi-node clusters as well as snapshots.\n","categories":"","description":"About persistent volumes (hostPath)\n","excerpt":"About persistent volumes (hostPath)\n","ref":"/docs/handbook/persistent_volumes/","tags":"","title":"Persistent Volumes"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs/benchmarks/","tags":"","title":"Benchmarks"},{"body":"9P Mounts 9P mounts are flexible and work across all hypervisors, but suffers from performance and reliability issues when used with large folders (\u003e600 files).

To increase the log verbosity, you can use:\n-v=1: verbose messages -v=2: really verbose messages -v=8: more log messages than you can possibly handle. Example:\nminikube start --alsologtostderr --v=2 will start minikube and output all the important debug logs to stderr.\nPost-mortem minikube debug logs minikube stores post-mortem logs in the temporary directory of your system. One log file is created per subcommand and any subsequent invocations of the subcommand with the same args will append to the same file. If the log file has exceeded 1MB in size, a new log file is created. On macOS or Linux, it’s easy to get a list of recent logs:\nfind $TMPDIR -mtime -1 -type f -name \"*minikube*\" -ls 2\u003e/dev/null For instance after running minikube start, the above command will show:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user grp 718 Aug 18 12:40 /var/folders/n1/qxvd9kc/T//minikube_start_dc950831e1a232e0318a6d6ca82aaf4f4a8a048b_0.log\nThese are plain text log files: you may rename them to “.log” and then drag/drop them into a GitHub issue for further analysis by the minikube team.
