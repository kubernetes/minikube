## PCI review checklist

<!-- heimdall_github_prtemplate:grc-pci_dss-2024-01-05 -->

- [ ] I have documented a clear reason for, and description of, the change I am making.

- [ ] If applicable, I've documented a plan to revert these changes if they require more than reverting the pull request.

- [ ] If applicable, I've documented the impact of any changes to security controls.

  Examples of changes to security controls include using new access control methods, adding or removing logging pipelines, etc.
