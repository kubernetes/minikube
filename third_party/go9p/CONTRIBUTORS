# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Go9p repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
# XXX more bumph here?
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
