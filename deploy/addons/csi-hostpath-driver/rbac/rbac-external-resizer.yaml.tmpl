# This YAML file contains all RBAC objects that are necessary to run external
# CSI resizer.
#
# In production, each CSI driver deployment has to be customized:
# - to avoid conflicts, use non-default namespace and different names
#   for non-namespaced entities like the ClusterRole
# - decide whether the deployment replicates the external CSI
#   resizer, in which case leadership election must be enabled;
#   this influences the RBAC setup, see below
