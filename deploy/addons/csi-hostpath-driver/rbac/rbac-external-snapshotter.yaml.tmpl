# Together with the RBAC file for external-provisioner, this YAML file
# contains all RBAC objects that are necessary to run external CSI
# snapshotter.
#
# In production, each CSI driver deployment has to be customized:
# - to avoid conflicts, use non-default namespace and different names
#   for non-namespaced entities like the ClusterRole
# - optionally rename the non-namespaced ClusterRole if there
#   are conflicts with other deployments
